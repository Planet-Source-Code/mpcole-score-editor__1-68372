### Description

This is a simple Score Editor in pure VB. You can create and edit Leadsheets with melody, songtext and chord-symbols.

At this time it's possible to use:

-notes and rests with different values (whole, half, quarter, 8th and 16th)

-dotted notes and triplets

-ties

-flat, sharp and natural keys

-different time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 2/4)

-different key signatures (only sharp)

-beams for 8th and 16th notes

-bar lines and repeat signs

It's also possible to play the leadsheet with MIDI and export it as a Bitmap file for printing (you can choose, how many bars are printed in one line).

IMPORTANT: The control is still under development and there are certainly some bugs and the code is very untidy.

Still to do for example:

-MIDI Im- and Export.

-Page break for Bitmap-Export

-Print function

-Automation for beams

-legato signs, and different dynamics and articulation marks

-flat key signatures

-maybe polyphony?

You can use it for whatever you want, but if you made a bigger modification, please send me a copy of your code to mp_cole@web.de.

Before using this code, you have to intall the true-type-font capella-invertiert.ttf on you PC. You can download it from: http://klausmeglitsch.heim.at/capella/userfiles/KlassischeFonts.zip.

Extract capella-ivertiert.ttf from the archive and put it in your font folder.

The MIDI-functions aren't from me but I cant't remember, where I've found them.

Sample-App and Comments are in German.
